Small project built with Django DRF and React.
It allows you to create a Treasure Hunt, by adding multiple clues.
Each clue is assigned a code that player will enter to receive the next clue.
Once you created it you can launch the game and player will be able to join the lobby.
You can then launch the game.
Each team will have different path to complete the treasure hunt so that players do not cross each other too much

Project is ready to be deployed on Heroku
